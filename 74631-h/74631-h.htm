<p class="title">PARIS</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FUTURE">THE FUTURE OF WAR</h2>
</div>


<p>It is no purpose of this little book to
discuss whether a repetition of war is
likely or unlikely, or to speculate on the
dawn of universal peace. The writer
prefers to take his stand on universal
experience, as contained in history,
observing that the path of history is
strewn with idealistic tombstones—the
Holy Alliance, the mid-Victorian Manchester
School, the Hague Conventions.
The Great Exhibition of 1851 was to
inaugurate a Golden Age, to be the
concrete symbol of the millennium, yet
within a decade the four chief Powers
in Europe had reconverted their ploughshares
into swords, and the North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
American continent was torn by a fratricidal
conflict. To abolish war we must
remove its cause, which lies in the
imperfections of human nature. The way
to “peace on earth” is by the progressive
and general growth of “good-will towards
men,” by a transformation of the spirit
of man instead of a futile attempt to bind
his fists—cords from which he can easily
break free, if so disposed. This changed
spirit must be world-wide, for peace-loving
nations, especially if prosperous
and possessed of rich territory who abandon
their defences, invite and indeed provoke
aggression as much as a flock of
well-nourished sheep with a lean and
hungry wolf in the fold. In the seventeenth
century the Protestant states of
North Germany complaining that the
expense of maintaining armed forces exceeded
the possible benefit of their protection,
prated thus—“let us behave with
justice to all men, and all men will behave
with justice towards us.” They speedily
found the fallacy of this faith in an imperfect
world, their protests of neutrality
an inadequate shield against the rapacity
of their neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>In the years immediately following the
Great War, idealists thought to cure the
ills of the body politic, as well as human,
by a monotonous repetition of the jingle,
“Day by day, and in every way, we are
getting better and better,” but disillusionment
came, and the peoples of the world
are realizing that international Couéism is
as futile to cure real disease as its pseudo-medical
counterpart.</p>

<p>Regarding war as a hard fact, as a
doctor called in to a sick patient views
disease, our concern here is simply with
the course of the malady, our object
being to gauge its future tendencies, in
order, if possible, to limit its ravages
and by scientific treatment ensure the
speedy and complete recovery of the
patient. As diagnosis comes before
treatment, the first step is to examine
the patient, estimate the gravity of his
condition, and discover the seat of the
trouble.</p>

<p>The Great War caused the direct
sacrifice of eight million lives, to which
the British Isles alone contributed three-quarters
of a million. So ineffectual was
the treatment prescribed by the military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
practitioners who were called in that the
illness took over four years to run its
course, during which the financial temperature
mounted daily, until for this
country alone it reached a cost of
£8,000,000 a day. Our total war
expenditure was nearly ten thousand
million pounds; our National Debt has
been increased tenfold. Moreover, these
long years of strain and want so impaired
the physical health of the peoples that
they fell an easy prey to epidemic
diseases, and the influenza scourge of
1918 and 1919 cost, among the civilian
population of the world, more than
twice as many lives as were lost in
battle.</p>

<p>It is surely clear that any further wars
conducted on similar methods must mean
the breakdown of Western civilization.
Is there an alternative? To answer this
question the obvious course is to ascertain
what were the foundations on which the
military leaders of the Great War built
their doctrine of war, and then to examine
these in the light of reason and
experience—as embodied in history. The
traditional military mind is notoriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
sensitive to any breath of criticism, and
any attempt to tear aside the veil of its
<em>mystery</em> is apt to be greeted by the cry of
“sacrilege.” Occasionally some daring
soldier has done so—and has paid the
penalty for exposing to lay eyes the emptiness
of the shrine. Thus Marshal Saxe
in his eighteenth-century <cite>Reveries</cite> on the
art of war, declared that “custom and
prejudice confirmed by ignorance are its
sole foundation and support,” for which
temerity Carlyle, the disciple and mouthpiece
of the Frederician dogmas, poured
scorn on his book as “a strange military
farrago, dictated, as I should think, under
opium.”</p>

<p>Similarly, a generation before the Great
War, Monsieur Bloch, the civilian banker
of Warsaw, forecast its nature with extraordinary
prescience, only to be ridiculed
by the General Staffs of Europe.
Yet the stalemate that he predicted would
arise from the clash of “nations in arms”
came true—with the sole difference that
he underestimated the blind obstinacy of
the leaders and the passivity of the led in
continuing for four more years to run
their heads against a brick wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Now, however, in these post-war years
of disillusionment, is the time to take
stock of the exorbitant cost of the war in
lives and money, of the moral and economic
exhaustion that is its fruit. Though
professional experience in any department
of life is the way to executive skill, concentration
on technical problems has a
notorious tendency to narrow the vision.
Hence, while paying tribute to the professional
ability shown in the later phases
of the 1918 campaign, we are justified,
standing amid the <i lang="fr">débris</i>, in questioning
the strategic aim and direction of the
war.</p>

<p>What was the objective of the Allies’
strategy? The memoirs and despatches
of the responsible military leaders reveal
that it was the destruction of the enemy’s
armed forces in the main theatre of war.</p>

<p>As the proverb tells us, it is no use
crying over spilt milk, nor even over spilt
blood and money—the price for this
empty triumph has been paid by the ordinary
citizens of the nations, yoked like
“dumb, driven oxen” to the chariot of
Mars.</p>

<p>What we are concerned with is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
future, and it is the worst of omens that
the orthodox military school, still generally
in power as the advisers of governments,
cling obstinately to this dogma,
blind apparently to the futility of the
Great War, both in its strategy and its
fruits. Of these military Bourbons, restored
to the seats of authority in most
capitals, the saying may be echoed:
“They have learnt nothing and forgotten
nothing”—if one may judge by the post-war
manuals of the various countries,
and the utterances of generals and
admirals.</p>

<p>New weapons would seem to be
regarded merely as an additional tap
through which the bath of blood can be
filled all the sooner. Not long ago, in
<cite>The Times</cite>, a distinguished admiral argued
that as “the first and greatest principle
of war” was the destruction of the
armed forces of the enemy, the only correct
objective for aircraft in war must be
the enemy air-force.</p>

<p>Thus in this new element, the air, is
to be reincarnated the Napoleonic theory—for
the doctrine on which the last war
was fought, and the next one will be if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
wisdom does not prevail, is the disastrous
legacy of the Corsican vampire, who
drained the blood of Europe a century
back.</p>

<p>From 1870 to 1918 the General Staffs
of the Powers were obsessed with the
Napoleonic legend; instead of reconnoitring
the future in the light of universal
history they were purely looking backward
on a military Sodom and Gomorrah,
until, like Lot’s wife, they and their
doctrines became petrified.</p>

<p>What is the tenor of this doctrine?
First, that there is only one true objective
in war—“the <em>destruction</em> of the enemy’s
main forces on the battlefield.” Even
the most hair-splitting partisan of the orthodox
school cannot dispute this statement
without throwing overboard all the
textbooks and regulations produced by the
General Staffs of Europe and America
for generations past. Second, that the
means of gaining this objective is to pile
up greater numbers than the enemy. Obviously
the surest way to achieve this is to
call up and put into the field the whole
manhood of a nation, and so has grown
up as a complement to the Napoleonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
theory of the “objective” another equally
short-sighted dogma—that of the “nation
in arms,” with its blind worship of quantity
rather than quality.</p>

<p>Pacifists are fond of talking about the
“armaments race.” A curious sort of race—for
which ponderous cart-horses are
bred instead of steeple-chasers, and where
the trainers clap “mass objective” blinkers
on the horses’ heads, while the jockeys
ride looking back over their shoulders.
Then they wonder why instead of taking
their fences freely the poor horses fall at
the first open ditch, and cannot be got out
under four years?</p>

<p>There would seem to be a slight hitch
somewhere in this Napoleonic doctrine.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ORIGINS">THE ORIGINS OF THE FALSE OBJECTIVE</h2>
</div>


<p>How arose this “blinkered” conception
that the national goal in war could be
attained only by mass destruction, and
how did it gain so firm a hold on military
thought? The decisive influence was exerted
not by Napoleon himself, though his
practical example of the beneficent results
of “absolute war” was its inspiration,
but by his great German expositor,
Carl von Clausewitz. He it was who, in
the years succeeding Waterloo, analysed,
codified, and deified the Napoleonic
method.</p>

<p>Clausewitz has been the master at
whose feet have sat for a century the
military students of Europe. From him,
the German Army in particular drew the
inspiration by which they evolved their
stupendous, if fundamentally unsound,
structure of “the nation in arms.” It
achieved its triumph in 1870 and, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
result, all the Powers hurried to imitate
the model, and to revive with ever greater
intensity the Napoleonic tradition, until
finally the gigantic edifice was put to an
extended test in the years 1914–1918—with
the result that in its fall it has
brought low not only Germany, but, with
it, the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>Thus, because of the unsoundness of
their foundations, Clausewitz’s theories
have ended by bringing his Fatherland
into a more impotent and impoverished
state even than when it was under the
iron heel of Napoleon. Clausewitz’s was
truly “a house built on sand.”</p>

<p>Yet, despite his main miscalculations,
he had a wider understanding of the
objects of war than most of his disciples.
Clausewitz did at least recognize the
existence of other objectives besides the
armed forces. He enumerated three
general objects—the military power, the
country, and the will of the enemy. But
his vital mistake was to place “the will”
last in his list, instead of first and embracing
all the others, and to maintain that
the destruction of the enemy’s main
armies was the best way to ensure the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
remaining objects. Similarly, the other
most famous military teacher of the
century before the Great War, Marshal
Foch, admitted the existence and wisdom,
under certain conditions, of other means,
but, as with Clausewitz, the reservations
were forgotten, and his disciples remembered
only his assertion that “the true
theory” of war was “that of the
absolute war which Napoleon had taught
Europe.”</p>

<p>This was but human nature, for the
followers of any great teacher demand a
single watchword, however narrow. The
idea of preserving a broad and balanced
point of view is anathema to the mass,
who crave for a slogan and detest the
complexities of independent thought. It
is not surprising that military thought
in recent generations, in its blind worship
of the idol of “absolute war,” has poured
scorn on the objectives of Napoleon’s
predecessors—curiously forgetting that
they at least gained the purpose of their
policy, whereas his ended in ruin. One
and all spoke and wrote with contempt
of these eighteenth-century strategists,
though they included such men as Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Saxe, whose writings bear the impress
of a mind perhaps more original and
unbiased by traditional prejudices than
any in military history.</p>

<p>Here is how Foch, in his <cite lang="fr">Principes de
Guerre</cite>, contrasts the exponents of the
rival theories: “Marshal de Saxe, albeit
a man of undeniable ability, said: ‘I am
not in favour of giving battle.... I am
even convinced that a clever general can
wage war his <em>whole life</em> without being
compelled to do so.’ Entering Saxony in
1806, Napoleon writes to Marshal Soult:
‘There is nothing I desire so much as a
great battle.’ The one wants to avoid
battle his whole life; the other demands
it at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>So that even a man of the intellectual
calibre of Marshal Foch thinks solely of
the tangible proofs of military victory,
with never a reflection as to which of
these two men best fulfilled ultimately
the national objective of an honourable,
secure, and prosperous future.</p>

<p>We see him greeting with approval the
dictum of Clausewitz: “Blood is the
price of victory. You must either resort
to it or give up waging war. All reasons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of humanity which you might advance
will only expose you to being beaten by a
less sentimental adversary.”</p>

<p>In the latter sentence we see the recurring
delusion of the traditional military
mind that the opposition to the Napoleonic
theory must necessarily be dictated
by mere sentimentalism. It disregards
the possibility that it may be due to a
far-sighted political economy, which does
not lose sight of the post-war years. A
prosperous and secure peace is a better
monument of victory than a pyramid of
skulls.</p>

<p>There are signs, however, that Marshal
Foch, in contrast to his intellectual compeers,
has gained from recent experience
a wider conception of the aims of war and
the true objective of military policy. In
a statement since the War on the subject
of air-power, he gave the weighty and
illuminating judgment that “The potentialities
of aircraft attack on a large scale
are almost incalculable, but it is clear that
such attack, owing to its crushing <em>moral
effect on a nation, may impress public
opinion to the point of disarming the
Government and thus become decisive</em>.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Here is a dramatic and far-reaching
break with the “armed forces” objective.
Perhaps also his connection with the Ruhr
policy is evidence of a grasp of the possibilities
not only of war without bloodshed,
but war without hostilities—the objective,
more effective than the enemy’s
military power, being control of the rival’s
industrial resources.</p>

<p>“Saul is numbered with the prophets!”
The champion and embodiment of the
Napoleonic doctrine appears to have cast
it overboard. We see an indisputable recognition
that two other objectives exist—one
moral, the other economic.</p>

<p>If the conversion comes a little late,
when we are enjoying the happy and
prosperous peace procured for us by the
method of “absolute war” so eloquently
preached in pre-war years by this august
teacher, it may at least acquit us of <i lang="fr">lèse-majesté</i>
in suggesting, that by their blind
worship of the Napoleonic idol, our recent
military guides not only narrowed
and distorted their whole conception of
war, but led us into the morass—financial,
commercial, and moral—wherein the
nations of Europe in greater or less degree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
are now engulfed—as was France
after Napoleon.</p>

<p>When the high priest of the orthodox
faith begins to have doubts, the moment
is ripe for those who do not hold that the
advent of Napoleon was the Year One of
military history, who are disciples of
earlier Great Captains, to endeavour, in
all humility, to propound a wider and
more scientific conception of war and its
true objective.</p>

<p>Thus, should the millennium of Universal
Peace fail to arrive, and nations still
continue to settle by an appeal to force
questions which vitally affect their policy,
it may be that they will learn to wage
war in a manner less injurious to the interwoven
fabric of modern civilization,
and incidentally to their own prosperity
and ultimate security, than proved the
case in the Great War of 1914–1918. Security—yes,
because the greater the injury
inflicted, the deeper are the sores of
the body politic, and in these the toxins of
revenge fester.</p>

<p>But to achieve this more scientific and
economic military policy it is necessary
that public opinion should be awakened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
not only to the results but also to the
false foundations of the present theory of
war.</p>

<p>The saying that “the onlooker sees
most of the game” is as true of the
broader aspects of war as of anything
else, and in the unfettered common sense
of the intelligent citizen, and its reaction
on those entrusted with the military
weapons, lies the quickest chance of deliverance
from this dogma—for military
authority holds with Bishop Warburton
that “orthodoxy is my doxy—heterodoxy
is another man’s doxy.”</p>

<p>Soldiers who refuse to bow in adoration
of Napoleon and Clausewitz, his prophet,
are condemned as heretics, and the repression
of the “Protestants” has been
made possible by the apathy of the public
towards military questions. Men of the
Anglo-Saxon race are not willing to hand
over their religious or political conscience
into the keeping of “authority,” yet by
their lack of interest in military questions
they do in fact relinquish any check on
a policy which affects the security of
their lives and livelihoods to an even
greater extent. For, when war bursts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
upon the nation, it is the ordinary citizens
who pay the toll either with their
lives or from their pockets. Only by
taking an active interest in the broad
aspects of national defence, and so regaining
control of their military conscience,
can they avoid being driven like
sheep to the shearer and slaughterhouse,
as in the last war.</p>

<p>If the citizens of a nation were asked
what should be the general aim of the
national policy, they would reply, in tenor
if not in exact words, that it should be
such as to guarantee them “an honourable,

<p>No normal citizen of a democracy
would willingly imperil this by a resort
to war. Only when he considers, or it is

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NATIONAL">THE NATIONAL OBJECTIVE IN WAR</h2>
</div>


<p>When, however, the fateful decision for
war has been taken, what does common
sense tell us should be the national objective?
To ensure a resumption and progressive
continuance of what may be
termed the peace-time policy, with the
shortest and least costly interruption of
the normal life of the country.</p>

<p>What stands in the way of this? The
determination of the hostile nation to enforce
its contrary policy in defiance of our
own aims and desires. To gain our aim or
objective we have to change this adverse
will into a compliance with our own
policy, and the sooner and more cheaply
in lives and money we can do this,
the better chance is there of a continuance
of national prosperity in the widest
sense.</p>

<p>The aim of a nation in war is, therefore,
to subdue the enemy’s will to resist,
with the least possible human and economic
loss to itself.</p>

<p>If we realize that this is the true
objective, we shall appreciate the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
that the <em>destruction</em> of the enemy’s armed
forces is but a means—and not necessarily
an inevitable or infallible one—to
the attainment of our goal. It is clearly
not, despite the assertion of military
pundits, the sole true objective in war.
Clear the air of the fog of catchwords
which surrounds the conduct of war,
grasp that in the human will lies the
source and mainspring of all conflict, as
of all other activities of man’s life, and
it becomes transparently clear that our
goal in war can only be attained by the
subjugation of the opposing will. All
<em>acts</em>, such as defeat in the field, propaganda,
blockade, diplomacy, or attack
on the centres of government and population,
are seen to be but means to that
end; and, instead of being tied to one
fixed means, we are free to weigh the
respective merits of each. To choose
whichever are most suitable, most rapid,
and most economic, <i>i.e.</i>, which will gain
the goal with the minimum disruption
of our national life during and <em>after</em> the
war. Of what use is decisive victory in
battle if we bleed to death as a result
of it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>A single man can be beaten by the
simple process of killing him. Not so a
nation—for total extermination, even if
it were possible, would recoil on the heads
of the victors in the close-knit organization
of the world’s society, and would involve
their own ethical and commercial
ruin—as we have had a foretaste from the
attrition policy of the Great War. But
besides being mutually deadly it is unnecessary,
for a highly organized state is
only as strong as its weakest link. In a
great war the whole nation is involved,
though not necessarily, or wisely, under
arms. The fists and the sinews of war
are mutually dependent, and, if we can
demoralize one section of the nation, the
collapse of its will to resist compels the
surrender of the whole—as the last
months of 1918 demonstrated.</p>

<p>It is the function of grand strategy
to discover and exploit the Achilles’ heel
of the enemy nation; to strike not
against its strongest bulwark but against
its most vulnerable spot. In the earliest
recorded war, Paris, son of Priam, King
of Troy, thus slew the foremost champion
of the Greeks. As the Greek legend runs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Achilles, when a child, having been dipped
by his mother, Thetis, in the waters of
the Styx, his whole body became invulnerable
save only the heel by which she
held him. In the Trojan war, after
Achilles had slain Hector in direct combat,
Paris brought stratagem to bear, and
his arrow, guided by Apollo, struck
Achilles in his vulnerable heel. It is significant
that Apollo, among his numerous
attributes, was held to be the sun god,
and the god of prophecy, for here surely
he forecast the future of war, and shed
light on the true objective—a ray of truth
too dazzling for the vision of all but a
few soldiers.</p>

<p>After dashing out the lives of millions
in vain assault against the enemy’s
strength, it might not be amiss now to
take a lesson from the objective aimed at
by Paris three thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Turning from myth to history, it may
be useful to glance at two authentic examples
of the use of the moral objective—which
in each case changed the course
of the world’s history.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HISTORICAL">HISTORICAL EXAMPLES OF THE MORAL OBJECTIVE</h2>
</div>


<p>First, from the Punic Wars. In the
struggle between Rome and Carthage
for the domination of the ancient world,
the two mother cities with their government
and population form the vital
points—the moral objective. Hannibal,
the Carthaginian leader, lives in history
as, with Napoleon, the supreme military
executant of all time. Yet similarly he
appears to lack the gift of “grand
strategical” vision. His objective is the
armed forces of the enemy, but even the
annihilating victory of Cannæ does not
bring him to his goal, because Rome itself
stands unmastered. The apologists for
Hannibal are legion, but they cannot
obscure the truth that by his failure to
gain Rome he ultimately lost Carthage.
Scipio Africanus, his ultimate conqueror
at Zama, suffers from the misfortune that
his own claims to fame are overshadowed
by his adversary’s dramatic victories
and heroic stand in Italy for so many
years, which appeal to the sentimental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
imagination. But Scipio’s appreciation
of the principle of the objective is surely
more profound. Instead of seeking a
decision in Italy, where his troops would
suffer under the moral influence of
Hannibal’s repeated victories in that
theatre, Scipio, in face of the most
weighty protests, embarks for Carthage.
His immediate objective is to free Italy,
and he realizes that a threat to Carthage
will so act upon the moral of the citizens
that they will recall Hannibal. The
result proves the soundness of his judgment.
Then, by striking at the resources
of Carthage in Northern Africa he
accomplishes the next step towards the
subjugation of the Carthaginian will,
and so to Zama, the flight of Hannibal
himself to the East, and the capitulation
of Carthage. Scipio’s moral objective
triumphs over the “armed forces” theory
of Hannibal.</p>

<p>Turning to the history of the modern
world, we have the example of the
campaign of 1814, which ended in
Napoleon’s abdication and relegation to
the Isle of Elba. Never perhaps in his
whole career does Napoleon’s genius shine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
so brightly as in that series of dramatic
victories in February and March, 1814,
by which he staggers the Allies, until, in
pursuit of the delusive military objective,
he over-reaches himself. He moves east
to fall upon Schwarzenberg’s rear, drawn
on by the theory of destroying the main
mass of the enemy’s forces. By this
move he uncovers Paris—and the Allies
march straight forward to gain the true
objective—the nerve centre of the French
will to resist. Paris is the prey of war
alarms and fatigue, in the very condition
for a moral detonator to wreck Napoleon’s
hold. The Royalist, de Vitrolles, tells
the Czar Alexander that “People are tired
of the war and of Napoleon. Consider
politics rather than strategy, and march
straight on Paris, where the true opinion
of the people will be shown the moment
the Allies appear.” Captured despatches
also bear witness to the underlying discontent
of the Capital. The Czar summons
a council of war. Barclay de Tolly,
the senior, urges that the forces should
be concentrated, to follow and attack
Napoleon. General Toll affirms that
there is only one true course, to “advance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
on Paris by forced marches with the
whole of our army, detaching only 10,000
cavalry to mask our movement.”</p>

<p>Barclay de Tolly disagrees and argues
the example—so hackneyed in later years—of
the occupation of Moscow. Toll
points out that the effect of the seizure
of Paris will be decisive economically and
morally, and that there is no true parallel
between the cases of Moscow and <em>Paris</em>—the
nodal point of France.</p>

<p>The Czar decides for Toll’s plans, the
army sweeps on Paris and enters in
triumph after but the slightest resistance,
while Napoleon is winning delusive successes
in Lorraine. When the news from
Paris reaches him, he thinks frantically
of a counter-march, but the moral germ
disseminated by the occupation of Paris
spreads even among his generals and
troops. Too late! So great are the moral
repercussions of the act, that in a brief
space Napoleon, with the people and his
satellites turned against him, is forced to
an unconditional abdication.</p>

<p>Some might suggest that the German
failure to achieve victory in 1914 is a
still more recent example of the truth that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the moral objective is the real one. History
may well decide that had the German
Higher Command been less obsessed with
the dream of a Cannæ manœuvre, and
struck at Paris first instead of attempting
to surround the French armies, “Deutschland
über alles” might now be an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>On the island of Corfu is a giant statue
of Achilles, with his heel transfixed by
the arrow. Countless hours the ex-Kaiser
spent gazing at this statue, yet its
message apparently made no impression.
“Whom the gods wish to destroy they
first make ...”—blind.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEANS">THE MEANS TO THE MORAL OBJECTIVE</h2>
</div>


<p>After this brief historical survey, let us
turn to consider the means by which the
moral objective, of subduing the enemy’s
will to resist, can be attained. These
means can be exercised in the military,
the economic, the political, or the social
spheres. Further, the weapons by which
they are executed may be military, economic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
or diplomatic—with which is included
propaganda.</p>

<p>As war is our subject, the diplomatic
and economic weapons, except in a
military guise, are outside our purview.
There appears little doubt, however, that
the economic weapon in the struggle between
rival national policies during so-called
peace has possibilities still scarcely
explored or understood. Again, the military
weapon can be wielded in the economic
sphere without any open state of
war existing. In the Ruhr we saw the
French aiming, by a military control of
Germany’s industrial resources, to subdue
the latter’s will to resist French policy,
and with the further motive of a moral
disruption between the German states.</p>

<p>What, however, are the ways in which
the military weapon can be employed
to subdue the enemy’s will to resist <em>in
war</em>?</p>

<p>The question demands that we first examine
how the moral attack takes effect,
and how the will of an enemy people is
reduced to such a degree that they will
sue for peace rather than face a continuation
of the struggle. Put in a nutshell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the result is obtained by dislocating their
normal life to such a degree that they will
prefer the lesser evil of surrendering their
policy, and by convincing them that any
return to “normalcy”—to use President
Harding’s term—is hopeless unless they
do so surrender. It is an old proverb that
“So long as there is life, there is hope,”
and this Ciceronian saw may be adduced
to support the argument that in the case
of people who fight best “with their
backs to the wall” only death will end
their resistance. This may be true of
individuals, or even of considerable bodies
of men; the annals of the Anglo-Saxon
race afford examples—though such cases
have almost always occurred when
surrender was as fatal as continued
resistance. As soldiers know well, time
throws an heroic glamour over events of
the past, and national pride leads to
pardonable exaggeration of great deeds.
Such <i lang="fr">résistance à mort</i> is probably as rare
as that mythical bayonet charge and
hand-to-hand clash with cold steel so
beloved of tradition and the painter of
battle scenes. The latter myth was
exposed by the long-dead Ardant du<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Picq, that French soldier-realist who
refused to bow before the altar of the
martial tradition. And the Great War
finally dissipated it. Imaginative soldiers,
especially those in the supply services,
might write letters home describing
such close quarter fights, war-correspondents
safely behind the lines might
retail such martial exploits for the benefit
of a sensation-loving public, but
the real fighting soldier soon found that
two sides did not cross bayonets in
mortal conflict. The weaker broke and
fled, or else threw up their hands as
token of surrender the moment they realized
the actual shock could no longer be
warded off.</p>

<p>The normal man, immediately he recognizes
a stronger, directly he realizes the
hopelessness of overcoming his enemy,
always yields. Nor is man unique in this
respect, as any study of animal life will
confirm.</p>

<p>Armies and nations are mainly composed
of normal men, not of abnormal
heroes, and once these realize the <em>permanent</em>
superiority of the enemy they will
surrender to <i lang="fr">force majeure</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>History, even Anglo-Saxon history,
shows that nations bow to the inevitable,
and abandon their policy rather than
continue a struggle once hope has vanished.
No war between civilized people
has been carried, nor anywhere near
carried, to the point of extermination.
The living alone retain the power to admit
defeat, and since wars, therefore, are
ended by surrender and not by extermination,
it becomes apparent that defeat is
the result not of loss of life, save, at the
most, indirectly and partially, but by loss
of moral.</p>

<p>The enemy nation’s will to resist is
subdued by the fact <em>or threat</em> of making
life so unpleasant and difficult for the
people that they will comply with your
terms rather than endure this misery. We
use the words “or threat” because sometimes
a nation, directly its means of resistance—its
forces—were overthrown,
has hastened to make peace before its
territory was actually invaded. Such
timely surrender is merely a recognition
of the inevitable consequences.</p>

<p>In what ways is this pressure exerted?
Partly through the stomach, partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
through the pocket, and partly through
the spirit. In the “good old days”
more forcible physical measures were
practised, burning, pillage, and rapine.
But in the present age the wholesale and
avowed use of such persuasive aids is
barred by the ethical code of nations—and
press publicity, though, as the last
war showed, still indulged in sporadically
with or without the specious excuse of
“reprisals.” But if the international
conscience is too tender to permit this
direct violence, it swallows its qualms
where the people’s will to resist is undermined
by the indirect method of wholesale
starvation. Deprive individuals of food
and there is an outcry, cut off the food
supply of a nation and the moral sense of
the world is undisturbed. Thus the naval
weapon is pre-eminently the means of
applying “stomach” pressure, because
its blockade is indirect instead of direct,
general instead of particular. As nothing
more surely undermines moral than
starvation, a blockade would seem obviously
the best means to gain the moral
objective were it not for two grave disadvantages.
First, it can only be successful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
where the enemy country is not
self-supporting, and can be entirely surrounded—or
at any rate its supplies from
outside effectively intercepted. Second, it
is slow to take effect, and so imposes a
strain on the resources of the blockading
country.</p>

<p>Pressure through “the pocket” can
be exerted directly by levies, confiscation,
or seizure of customs—which require a
military occupation—and indirectly by
the general dislocation of business and
the stoppage of the enemy’s commerce.
Above all, as the military forces of a
modern nation are but the wheels of the
car of war, dependent for their driving
power on the engine—the nation’s
industrial resources—it follows that a
breakdown in the engine or in the transmission—the
means of transport and
communication—will inevitably render
the military forces immobile and powerless.
Just as the engine and transmission
of an automobile, because of the intricacy
and delicacy of their joints and working
parts, are far more susceptible to damage
than the road wheels, so in a modern
nation at war its industrial resources and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
communications form its Achilles’ heel.
Mere common sense should tell us that if
possible these are the points at which to
strike.</p>

<p>Pressure on “the spirit” is intimately
connected with that on “the pocket,” a
thorough and long-continued interruption
of the normal life of a nation is as depressing
and demoralizing as the intimidation
of the people by methods of terrorism—which,
even if temporarily successful,
usually react among civilized nations to
the detriment of the aggressor by stimulating
the will to resist or by so outraging
the moral sense of other nations as to pave
the way for their intervention.</p>

<p>In the past a military occupation of the
hostile country has generally been the
ultimate method of bringing to bear this
pressure on the spirit, and may still be
necessary against semi-civilized peoples
spread out in little self-supporting communities,
whose material wants are simple,
and who offer no highly organized industrial
and economic system for attack or
control by an enemy.</p>

<p>But though the indignity and restrictions
that arise from a military occupation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
are always galling, the conscience of
the world forbids, or at least limits, the
terrorism of earlier times and so makes
the mere presence of an invading army
less irksome. Conversely, with the growth
of civilization the dislocation or control
of an enemy’s industrial centres and communications
becomes both more effective
and more easy as the means by which to
subdue his will to resist.</p>

<p>Every modern industrial nation has
its vitals; in one case it may be essential
mining areas, in another manufacturing
districts, a third may be dependent on
overseas trade coming into its ports, a
fourth so highly centralized that its capital
is the real as well as the nominal heart
of its life. In most cases there is a blend
of these several factors, and in all the
regular flow of transport along its arteries
is a vital requirement.</p>

<p>As warships are tied to the sea, they
cannot penetrate into an enemy country;
as, moreover, they are notoriously at a
disadvantage against land defences, they
cannot even occupy his ports. Hence
they are limited to indirect action against
the enemy’s vitals—either by blockade,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
by enabling troops to be landed, or nowadays
by serving as a mobile base for aircraft
which can strike at “nerve centres”
within some 250 miles of the coast.</p>

<p>Armies have hitherto been the means of
“direct action,” whether against the resources
of the enemy nation, the intimidation
of the people, or by the capture
or overthrow of individuals who were the
mainspring of the opposing policy.</p>

<p>Armies, however, suffer one serious
handicap in subduing the hostile will.
Being tied to one plane of movement,
compelled to move across the land, it has
rarely been possible for them to reach
the enemy capital or other vital centres
without first disposing of the enemy’s
main army, which forms the shield of the
opposing government and nation. It was
because of this age-long limitation that
the short-sighted, if natural, delusion
arose that the armed forces themselves
were the real objective.</p>

<p>But the air has introduced a third
dimension into warfare, and with the advent
of the aeroplane new and boundless
possibilities are introduced. Hitherto war
has been a gigantic game of draughts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Now it becomes a game of halma.
Aircraft enables us <em>to jump over</em> the army
which shields the enemy government,
industry, and people, and <em>so strike direct
and immediately at the seat of the opposing
will and policy</em>. A nation’s nerve-system,
no longer covered by the flesh
of its troops, is now laid bare to attack,
and, like the human nerves, the progress
of civilization has rendered it far more
sensitive than in earlier and more primitive
times.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="AIR">THE AIR WEAPON</h2>
</div>


<p>In the Great War aircraft filled but an
auxiliary <em>rôle</em> to the established arms, and
their action against the moral objective
was merely sporadic. The blow planned
against Berlin, which might have revealed
beyond question the decisive influence of
the new arm, was still-born because of
Germany’s haste to conclude an armistice.
Those who depreciate the value of the
air attack point to the comparatively
small damage wrought by any particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
attack in the Great War, arguing also that
the influx of recruits after some of them
showed that such “frightfulness” brought
its own recoil in a stiffening of the
national “upper lip.”</p>

<p>The best answer to this short-sighted
deduction is to present a few facts.
Between the 31st of May, 1915, and the
20th May, 1918, the German air-raids
over the London area were carried out
with an aggregate force of 13 Zeppelins
and 128 aeroplanes, dropping in all less
than 300 tons of bombs. The total result
was 224 fires, 174 buildings completely
destroyed, and 619 seriously damaged, a
damage estimated in money at something
over £2,000,000. This was achieved for
the most part in face of strong air and
ground defences, and in a war where the
total British air force was never markedly
inferior in size to its enemy, indeed generally
the reverse.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment take a modern
comparison, simply to point the moral.
France has 990 aeroplanes in the home
country, Great Britain 312—and this is
a notable increase on the situation two
years ago. Even allowing an ample margin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of aircraft to hold the British air
fleet in check, it would be easily possible
for a greater weight of bombs to be
dropped on London in one day than in
the whole of the Great War, and to repeat
the dose at frequent and brief intervals.</p>

<p>A damage spread over three years is a
flimsy basis on which to estimate the
moral and material results of such a blow
concentrated on a single day, delivered
with an accuracy and destructive effect
unrealizable by the primitive instruments
of 1915–1918. Moreover, what is an air
fleet of a thousand compared with future
possibilities, as civil aviation develops?</p>

<p>Witnesses of the earlier air attacks
before our defence was organized, will
not be disposed to underestimate the panic
and disturbance that would result from a
concentrated blow dealt by a superior air
fleet. Who that saw it will ever forget
the nightly sight of the population of a
great industrial and shipping town, such
as Hull, streaming out into the fields on
the first sound of the alarm signals?
Women, children, babies in arms, spending
night after night huddled in sodden
fields, shivering under a bitter wintry sky—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
exposure must have caused far more
harm than the few bombs dropped from
two or three Zeppelins.</p>

<p>Of the crippling effect on industrial
output, let facts speak: “In 1916, hostile
aircraft <em>approached</em> the Cleveland district
in thirteen different weeks—which reduced
the year’s output in that district by
390,000 tons (of pig-iron), or one-sixth
of the annual output. In certain armament
works it was observed that on the
days following raids, skilled men made
more mistakes in precision work than
usual, the quality of the work done was
inferior, while air raids made a constant
output impossible.”</p>

<p>Those pundits who prate about the
“armed forces” objective appear to forget
that an army without munitions is a
somewhat useless instrument.</p>

<p>Imagine for a moment that, of two
centralized industrial nations at war, one
possesses a superior air force, the other a
superior army. Provided that the blow
be sufficiently swift and powerful, there
is no reason why within a few hours, or
at most days from the commencement of
hostilities, the nerve system of the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
inferior in air power should not be
paralysed.</p>

<p>A modern state is such a complex and
interdependent fabric that it offers a
target highly sensitive to a sudden and
overwhelming blow from the air. We all
know how great an upset in the daily life
of the country is caused at the outset
of a railway strike even. Business is
disorganized by the delay of the mails
and the tardy arrival of the staff, the
shops are at a standstill without fresh
supplies, the people feel lost without
newspapers—rumours multiply, and the
signs of panic and demoralization make
their appearance. Perhaps an even more
striking parallel may be found in the
disruption of the whole life of Japan in
the recent earthquake. An air attack of
the intensity that is now possible would
be likely to excel even this stroke in its
disorganizing and demoralizing effect.
Imagine for a moment London, Manchester,
Birmingham, and half a dozen other
great centres simultaneously attacked,
the business localities and Fleet Street
wrecked, Whitehall a heap of ruins, the
slum districts maddened into the impulse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
to break loose and maraud, the railways
cut, factories destroyed. Would not the
general will to resist vanish, and what use
would be the still determined fractions
of the nation, without organization and
central direction?</p>

<p>Victory in air war will lie with
whichever side first gains the moral
objective. If one side is so foolish as to
waste time—more the supreme factor
than ever before—in searching for the
armed forces of the enemy, which are
mobile and capable of concealment,
then clearly the static civil centres of its
own land will be paralysed first—and
the issue will be decided long before the
side which trusted in the “armed forces”
objective has crossed the enemy’s frontiers.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the decisiveness
of the moral objective be admitted, is it
not the height of absurdity to base the
military forces of a nation on infantry,
which would—even if unopposed—take
weeks to reach Essen or Berlin, for example,
when aircraft could reach and destroy
both in a matter of hours?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OBJECTIONS">OBJECTIONS TO THE AIR-ATTACK</h2>
</div>


<p>To this use of aircraft to gain the moral
objective there are, however, two possible
objections, one economic, the other ethical.
The economic limitation is that by
destroying the enemy factories and communications
we may so cripple his commerce
and industry as seriously to reduce
his post-war value as a potential customer.
There is a certain weight in this argument,
for if one lesson stands out clearly
from the last war it is that the commerce
and prosperity of civilized nations are
so closely interwoven and interdependent
that the destruction of the enemy country’s
economic wealth recoils on the
head of the victor. The obvious reply,
however, is that even the widespread damage
of a decisive air attack would inflict
less total damage and constitute less of
a drain on the defeated country’s recuperative
powers than a prolonged war of
the existing type.</p>

<p>The ethical objection is based on the
seeming brutality of an attack on the civilian
population, and the harmful results to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
the aggressor of any outrage of the human
feelings of the neutral peoples. The
events of the last war have, however, in
some measure acclimatised the world to
the idea that in a war between nations the
damage cannot be restricted merely to the
paid gladiators. When, moreover, the
truth is realized that a swift and sudden
blow of this nature inflicts a total of
injury far less than when spread over
a number of years, the common sense of
mankind will show that the ethical objection
to this form of war is at least not
greater than to the cannon-fodder wars of
the past.</p>

<p>But self-interest as well as humane
reasons demand that the warring nations
should endeavour to gain their end of
the moral subjugation of the enemy with
the infliction of the least possible permanent
injury to life and industry, for
the enemy of today is the customer of
the morrow, and the ally of the future.
To inflict widespread death and destruction
is to damage one’s own future
prosperity, and, by sowing the seeds of
revenge, to jeopardize one’s future
security. Chemical science has provided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
mankind with a weapon which reduces
the necessity for killing and achieves
decisive effects with far less permanent
injury than in the case of explosives.
Gas may well prove the salvation of
civilization from the otherwise inevitable
collapse in case of another world war.
Even with the lethal gases of the last
war, the use of which was decried as
barbarous by conventional sentiment,
statistics show that the proportion of
deaths to the numbers temporarily
incapacitated was far less than with the
accepted weapons, such as bullets and
shells! Moreover, chemistry affords us
non-lethal gases which can overcome
the hostile resistance, and spread panic
for a period long enough to reap the
fruits of victory, but without the lasting
evils of mass killing or destruction of
property.</p>

<p>Yet we still find that, in defiance of
reason and history, the governments are
again striving by international legislation
to prohibit the use of gas, and to confine
the blows of aircraft to the traditional
military objectives.</p>

<p>It is a strange reflection on the all-too-frequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
lack of vision and common sense,
that the opposition to the use of gas in
war comes from an alliance between those
unwonted bedfellows, the traditional militarist
and the sentimental pacifist.</p>

<p>The humanization of war rests not in
“scraps of paper,” which nations will
always tear up if they feel that their
national life is endangered by them, but
in the enlightened realization that the
spread of death and destruction endangers
the victor’s own future prosperity and
reputation.</p>

<p>This deeper understanding of war and
its goal, and consequently more humane
methods, can only come by stripping war
of its professional and pacifist catchwords,
and grasping that the true national
objective in war lies in the after-war. If
the civilized world is to be saved from
collapse, there is an urgent need to produce
true grand strategists to replace the
colour-blind exponents of mass destruction,
who can only see “red.”</p>

<p>No more terrible portent for the future
exists than the fact that the militarist
nations are awaking to the <em>destructive</em>
possibilities of the new weapons, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the Anglo-Saxon peoples, who are the
leaders of <em>constructive</em> human progress,
and hence might be expected to take
longer views, refuse to think or talk
about the subject, either from war-weariness
or natural antipathy to war. Like
the legendary ostrich burying its head
in the sand, they seemingly hope to
escape the danger by shutting it out of
sight.</p>

<p>Absorbed in building the Temple of
Peace, they neglect to take into account
the stresses and strains the edifice may
have to bear—and then, as before in
history, are surprised when their plaster
and stucco temple collapses under the
rude blast of international storms.</p>

<p>Of these two new weapons, air supremacy
is possessed by France, chemical
resources by Germany. A significant
fact is that France lacks the foundations
on which to build up a great chemical
plant, whereas Germany, in her rapidly
developing civil aviation, has a potential
instrument whereby to employ her
chemical weapons, with relatively slight
adaptation. Thus it may not be inapt
to quote the views of a high German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
authority, General von Altrock, in the
<cite lang="de">Militar-Wochenblatt</cite>: “In wars of the
future the initial hostile attacks will be
decided against the great nerve and communication
centres of the enemy’s territory,
against its large cities, factory
centres, munition areas, water, gas, and
light supplies; in fact, against every life
artery of the country. Discharge of poisonous
gases will become the rule since
great progress has been made in the production
of poison gas. Such attacks will
be carried to great depths in rear of the
actual fighting troops. Entire regions
inhabited by peaceful population will be
continually threatened with extinction.
The war will frequently have the appearance
of a destruction <em>en masse</em> of the entire
civil population rather than a combat
of armed men.”</p>

<p>The curtain is raised a little more in
the new German manual <cite lang="de">Der Chemische
Krieg</cite>, which was ably summarized
recently by the Berlin correspondent of
<cite>The Times</cite>. As this manual has a
number of quotations from the present
writer’s views on future warfare, he
proposes to repay the compliment by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
quoting certain most significant remarks
by the authors of this manual: gas is
termed “a vital weapon put into the
hands of the nation most highly developed
in science and technology,” and one
which will “confer world importance or
even world power, on the nation which
shows supreme capacity in the field”—if
we did not guess it, a study of Germany’s
other post-war manuals would
leave us no doubt that the Fatherland is
the country cast for this <em>rôle</em>. This conclusion
is reinforced by the comments of
<cite>The Times</cite> correspondent: “The authors
of this handbook declare that since the
end of the war no military question has
been the field of so much research, and
we may conclude that Germany, with her
highly-developed chemical industry, has
not lagged behind in this respect. ‘It is
understandable,’ they say, ‘that a thick
veil of secrecy obscures these preparations....’”</p>

<p>Of the military advantage of gas,
especially for a surprise at the outset of
war, there is no question. It is the only
weapon which is a commercial product,
manufactured from chemicals which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
an essential requirement of peace time
industry. In secrecy of manufacture it
is unrivalled, and so can defeat the
intelligence service of other powers. All
other weapons are, in part at least,
destined for a definite military purpose,
and therefore their production in quantity
cannot be kept a complete secret. In
speed of discharge it is necessarily supreme
because it is <em>continuous</em>, which not
even the quickest firing gun can be, and
in surprise of discharge also, because it is
noiseless and, if used at night or combined
with smoke, invisible. Its volume and
area of effect is infinitely greater than
any projectile—the most rapid-firing-missile-projector,
the machine-gun, can
only fire 600 bullets a minute, whereas
the gas cylinder can discharge millions of
invisible bullets or particles in the same
time; unlike any projectile it leaves no
voids unswept in its beaten zone; it
requires no skill in aiming, and is therefore
unaffected by the conditions or
physical defects of the firer.</p>

<p>Such are the properties of this ideal
weapon, which international jurists
fondly believe their parchment decrees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
will rule out of future war! However
blind to the lessons of history, do they
really believe that a nation which plans
a military coup, or a “revanche,” will
discard its strongest trump?</p>

<p>If, then, gas seems destined to replace
the bullet and the shell, so equally does
the aeroplane appear likely to supersede
the gun as the means of projection—and,
like gas, aircraft are a weapon not
exclusively military, but resting on a
civil basis. Their transformation from
a civil to a military use is far simpler
than with any of the old-established
arms. This fact has a vital bearing on
the present world situation, for the
geographical situation of the continental
countries, France and Germany in particular,
lends itself to the expansion of
air transport far better than that of
Great Britain, and thus in any race for
air supremacy the former obtain a
“flying” start difficult to over-value.
In the present stage of aircraft development
the central position of these continental
countries makes them the natural
hub of Europe’s air routes. England, in
contrast, is thrown back into her mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
position, before the Age of Discovery
led to the development of trans-ocean
shipping—in semi-isolation on <em>the edge</em>
of the continental transport system.
Though the aerial successors of Columbus
have already linked the New and Old
Worlds, it must still be some time before
trans-ocean flying becomes a normal
service. Then, and only then, will the
axis of air communications again be
shifted to the British Isles, as was that
of sea transport by the original discovery
of America.</p>

<p>As for the two great Pacific powers,
the United States are in an excellent position
for the growth of a strong civil
aviation, because the vast breadth of
North America places a premium on any
new and speedier form of transport,
whereas Japan suffers, in greater degree,
the disadvantages of England’s insular
and border situation, so that her air development
must perforce be an artificial
military growth instead of springing
naturally from civil “roots.”</p>

<p>Moreover, these can only grow firmly
and spread in an industrial soil—in the
mechanical future of war supremacy will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
go to the nation with the greatest industrial
resources.</p>

<p>But Americans would do well to
remember that the Japanese military
leaders are disciples of Clausewitz, and
that one of his axioms reads: “A small
state which is involved with a superior
power, and foresees that each year its
position will become worse,” should, if
it considers war inevitable, “seize the
time when the situation is furthest from
the worst,” and attack. It was on
this principle that Japan declared
war on Russia, and <em>for the United
States the next decade is the danger
period</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OBSOLETE">ARE ARMIES AND NAVIES OBSOLETE?</h2>
</div>


<p>In view of the transcendent value of
aircraft as a means of subduing the
enemy will to resist, by striking at the
moral objective, the question may well
be asked: Is the air the sole medium of
future warfare? That this will be the
case ultimately we have no doubt, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the advantages of a weapon able to move
in three dimensions over those tied to
one plane of movement are surely obvious
to all but the mentally blind. But we
are dealing with the immediate future,
and an uncertain period may elapse
before aircraft can combine with their
superior power of movement the radius
of action, reliability and hitting power of
the other weapons. In pointing out the
decisiveness of an air blow at the enemy
nation’s nerve system, we pre-supposed
two conditions; first, a superior air
force; second, a centralized objective
such as a highly-developed industrial
state offers. The European nations and
Japan afford such a target to air attack,
but not so a country as vast as the United
States; until the latter develops into a
more closely-knit fabric, and the radius
of air action is greatly increased, an air
attack against it could hardly be decisive,
however locally unpleasant. Washington
laid in ruins would merely provide
“Main Street” with a fresh supply of
small talk; New York paralysed would
leave the Middle West unmoved, even the
desolation of the Pacific coast would but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
inconvenience the “movie fans” of the
nation.</p>

<p>Moreover, though, in Europe, an air
blow would be decisive, its achievement
would probably depend on one side being
superior in the air, either in numbers of
aircraft or by the possession of some
surprise device. Where air equality
existed between the rival nations, and
each was as industrially and politically
vulnerable, it is possible that either would
hesitate to employ the air attack for fear
of instant retaliation.</p>

<p>A boxer with a punch in either fist
enjoys both a moral and a physical
advantage, and the same is true of a
nation that, if its initial air blow is
frustrated or is lacking in the necessary
margin of superiority, can bring another
weapon into play.</p>

<p>This truth is but the translation into
future grand strategy of the immemorial
key to victory used by the Great Captains
of War—<em>striking at the enemy from two
directions simultaneously</em>, so that in trying
to parry the one blow he exposes
himself to the other.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the continuance of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
alternative weapon to the aeroplane does
not mean that armies, at least, will
survive in their present form. An existing
pattern army has as much “punch”
as a stuffed bolster—size is no criterion
of hitting power.</p>

<p>If, however, the sea and land weapons
are likely to continue until the air weapon
reaches maturity, a study of the future
of war would be incomplete without a
discussion of their tendencies and
development—and of the ways by
which they may help to gain the moral
objective.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="NAVAL">THE NAVAL WEAPON</h2>
</div>


<p>A fleet suffers one fundamental limitation
on its freedom of action—it is tied
to the sea. Hence it cannot strike
directly at the hostile nation. Its action
is either directed against the enemy’s
stomach, and through that to his moral,
or in conveying and serving as a floating
base for troops or aircraft.</p>

<p>As with land warfare, the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
of the enemy’s main fleet is often spoken
of as the objective, whereas in reality this
act is but a means towards it—by the
destruction of the enemy’s shield the way
is opened for a more effective blockade
or for the landing of an army. Like land
warfare, also, the knowledge that its
coasts are thus rendered defenceless, may
cause a nation to sue for peace rather
than await inevitable starvation or invasion.</p>

<p>But just as the value of armies has been
radically affected by the conquest of the
air, so has that of surface fleets by the
coming of that other new and three-dimensional
weapon, the submarine. Instead
of hopping over the enemy’s shield
as does the aeroplane, the submarine
dives under it. In the Great War a submarine
blockade almost brought the
supreme naval power to its knees by
starvation—yet Germany never had more
than 175 submarines.</p>

<p>The fundamental purpose of a navy is
to protect a nation’s sea communications
and sever those of the enemy, and as,
therefore, <em>blockade</em> is the main offensive
<em>rôle</em> of the naval weapon, it behooves us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
examine the future of this means to the
moral objective.</p>

<p>Since the war controversy has raged
round the respective merits of the battleship,
submarine, and naval aeroplane, as
<em>destructive weapons</em>. Into this I have no
intention of entering—not only because
the problem demands a technical knowledge
of sea warfare to which I have no
pretensions, but also because the rival
arguments, in their absorption with a
means, overlook the end. Steering clear
of the Sargasso Sea of technical values,
let us rather direct our course, by the
compass of grand strategy, on the true
objective of the naval weapon. Nations
cannot afford to stake their existence on a
gamble in “futures,” and therefore until
a new weapon has attained an all-round
superiority to the existing ones, it would
be rash to adopt it exclusively. The
battleship retains the sovereignty of the
<em>oceans</em> for some time to come at least,
but in the <em>narrow seas</em> has yielded pride
of place to the submarine—if the lessons
of the Great War be assessed. Here is
the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>Thus France is wise in concentrating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
mainly on the new weapon, whereas Great
Britain and the United States, being concerned
equally with ocean communications,
cannot yet afford to abandon the
surface-going capital ship.</p>

<p>The vital question of the future is how
this transfer of power over the narrow
seas affects the international situation—particularly
that of Great Britain, which
is concerned with both spheres of sea-power.</p>

<p>Glance for a moment at a map of
Europe—it will be seen that Great
Britain lies like a huge breakwater across
the sea approaches to Northern Europe,
with Ireland as a smaller breakwater
across the approaches to Great Britain.
We realize that in the Great War, Germany
was in the most unfavourable
position possible for blockading England’s
sea communications, her submarines
having first to get outside this breakwater
through a narrow outlet sown with
mines and closely watched, and on completion
of this mission make the same
hazardous return to their bases. No
stronger proof of the potential menace of
the submarine in future war can be found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
than that Germany, with so few submarines
and despite such an immense
handicap, sank 8,500,000 tons of shipping,
and all but stopped the beat of Britain’s
heart.</p>

<p>Contrast with this the geographical
position of France, the chief submarine
power of the immediate future. Her
Atlantic bases lie directly opposite the
sea approaches to the British Isles—in
an ideal position for submarine action to
block the sea arteries on which England’s
life depends. Of potential significance
also is the position of Ireland, an outer
breakwater lying across the gateways to
Great Britain, for should Ireland ever
lend its harbours to an enemy as submarine
bases, the odds would be hopeless.</p>

<p>Turn again to the Mediterranean,
another long and narrow sea channel
through which runs our artery with the
East, and where our main naval force is
now concentrated. Note that our ships,
naval or mercantile, must traverse the
<em>length</em> of this channel, and worse still,
have to filter through a tiny hole at each
end—the straits of Gibraltar and the Suez
Canal—while midway there is a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
“waist” between Sicily and Tunis,
barely ninety miles across.</p>

<p>Then look at the geographical position
of Toulon and of the French naval ports
on the North African coast, and note how
the <em>radii</em> of submarine attack intersect
the long single line of British sea communication.
Is it not obvious that if in a
future war any Mediterranean power was
numbered among Britain’s enemies, her
fleet would find it difficult enough to protect
itself against submarines, let alone
protect merchant convoys and troop transports?
When to the proved menace of
submarine power is added the potential
effect of aircraft attack against shipping
in the narrow seas, it is time the British
people awoke to the fact that, in case of
such a war, the Mediterranean would be
impassable, and that this important artery
would have to be abandoned. Thus, as a
strategical asset, the Suez Canal has lost
a large part of its value in face of modern
naval and air development—for in such
a war we should be driven to close the
Mediterranean route, and divert our imperial
communications round the Cape of
Good Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Nor can it do any harm for our politicians
and people to realize the unquestionable
if unpalatable fact that the existence
of this country is dependent on the
good-will of France, the supreme air and
submarine power commanding both the
vital centres of England and our oversea
communications at their most vulnerable
points—that “Paris” is able to shoot at
our Achilles’ heel, and has “two strings
to its bow” for the purpose.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="ARMY">THE ARMY WEAPON</h2>
</div>


<p>Finally, what is the future of this
alternative “punch” to the air attack?
No future, assuredly, unless the army
limb of the body military is thoroughly
overhauled and inoculated with the serum
of mobility, for the present type of army
is suffering from chronic rheumatoid
arthritis, its joints far too stiff to deliver
an effective punch. The outstanding
lesson of the Great War was the powerlessness
of the high commands to attain
decisive successes—a condition due to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
three main factors. First, the unwieldy
masses put into the field allowed neither
opportunity nor room for manœuvre; second,
these slow-moving infantry masses
were too vulnerable a target to modern
fire-weapons; third, their numbers imposed
so great a strain on the means of
supply that offensive after offensive was
stultified by the breakdown of communications—the
commanders of the Great
War were as unhappily placed as the
proverbial puppy with a tin can attached
to its tail.</p>

<p>The years 1914–18 show the “Nation
in Arms” theory carried to its climax;
numbers of troops and quantity of <em>material</em>
had been the ruling ideas of the General
Staffs of Europe for half a century.
What was the upshot? That generalship
became the slave of the monster it had
created. The artist of war yielded
place to the artisan, because we forgot
the text preached by Marshal Saxe two
centuries before, that “multitudes serve
only to perplex and embarrass.” Watching
it from across the Styx, Marshal
Saxe can be imagined as uttering that
favourite quotation of his: “War is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
trade for the ignorant, a science for men
of genius.”</p>

<p>What are the obvious deductions from
the three factors we have mentioned?</p>

<p>The rear communications of existing
armies are based on railways, the advanced
communications on roads, both of
which have proved inadequate to stand
even the <em>internal</em> strain of modern warfare.
In the last war they suffered little
<em>external</em> interference from enemy aircraft,
but in the future this is a certainty.
Both these means of communication depend
on fixed tracks, which cannot be
varied save after a long period of labour
and preparation; since they are shown on
the map they are easily located and can
be kept under observation from the air.
If railways, because of their visibility and
limited number of routes, are in themselves
the more vulnerable, no more helpless
target exists than long columns of
slow-moving infantry on the march. A
vivid picture of the chaos caused by air
attack is to be found in Major-General
Gathorne-Hardy’s account of the ghastly
fate of the Austrian columns and transport
after Vittorio Veneto in October,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
1918. If they are not bombed out of existence,
air-attack will at least force them
to disperse and take cover so frequently
as to slow up their rate of advance to
a snail’s pace, while days of bombing by
hostile aircraft will hardly be a tonic for
their moral.</p>

<p>Thus the nation which continues to
base its military communications on railways
and roads is running for a fall.
What is the alternative? The opposite
method to tracked movement is trackless—by
means of caterpillar track or
multi-wheeled vehicles capable of quitting
the roads at will on the approach of
hostile aircraft, and of advancing on a
wide front, instead of through a bottleneck.</p>

<p>If infantry, because of certain limitations
on tank-action, may still survive
for a time as a battle-instrument, it is
the merest common sense that they should
be transported to the battlefield, their
3–5 m.p.h. legs replaced by 15–25 m.p.h.
mechanical tracks—not only because
they may thus be kept fresh for their
fighting <em>rôle</em>, but because otherwise they
will never reach the battlefield at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>The advent of aircraft has had another
important consequence. Just as in the
wider sphere, their power to hop over a
hostile army enables them to strike
direct at the political and industrial
centres of the nation, so in the zone of
the armies has it laid bare the life-line of
the hostile army itself—its communications.</p>

<p>The obvious antidote to this new development
is to make the communications
fluid instead of rigid, and by putting the
supply and transport of armies on a trackless
basis, we not only revive their
“punch” by endowing them with mobility,
but extract much of the sting from
the military form of the air attack.</p>

<p>Turning to the second factor, that of
vulnerability <em>in battle</em>, here again a new
weapon has revolutionized the methods
of warfare by providing soldiers with a
machine-made skin to offset the deadliness
of modern fire. Not that armour is
a new invention, but until the advent of
the tank provided him with mechanical
legs, man’s muscle-power was insufficient
to move him when enclosed in an
armoured shell. Navies changed long ago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
from muscle-power to machine-power,
alike for hitting, protection, and movement.
Armies had to lag behind until
the invention of the motor because they
could not ask the already over-burdened
foot-soldier to carry armour—if he had
been given it he could not have moved it.
Now, however, that a means has been
invented, is it not irrational to stand out
against the lessons of national progress,
to refuse to free the soldier’s mind and
spirit—his real military assets—from the
fetters imposed by his bodily limitations?</p>

<p>Military conservatives are prone to
talk of “Men <i>v.</i> Machines,” as if they
were conflicting ideals, whereas in reality
neither opposition nor comparison is
possible. We should not fall into the
absurdity of comparing man with a
locomotive or a sculptor with his tools,
and mechanical weapons are but the
instruments of man’s brain and spirit.
The reactionary who opposes the inevitable
course of evolution forgets that
the question of muscle-force <i>versus</i>
machine-force was settled away back in
the Stone Age when the prehistoric
fighting man discovered that a flint-axe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
was a more potent weapon than his bare
fist. Moral depends ultimately on confidence,
and even the finest troops will lose
their moral if they are reduced to the <em>rôle</em>
of mere human stop-butts, powerless to
hit back.</p>

<p>The layman is apt to feel mystified by
the fog of technical controversy that
surrounds the merits of the various arms.
To dissipate this by a breeze of common
sense, let us put the simple question: How
can the old-established arms combat the
new—tanks and aircraft?</p>

<p>First, infantry—whose weapons are
machine-guns, light automatics and rifles.
They cannot attack the tank, because
even if they had weapons that could
penetrate the tank’s armour, the latter’s
speed would enable it to avoid conflict at
will. Similarly, infantry have no power
to hit the aeroplane unless it swoops
very low, whereas it can remain at a
moderate height and bomb its helpless
foes.</p>

<p>For defence against either, infantry are
dependent on the help of other arms or on
going to earth like rabbits—in which case
their offensive value in war is <em>nil</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>A business which retained the aged and
infirm as the bulk of its employees would
soon be bankrupt; it may find use for a
few as caretakers—and that is the only
feasible <em>rôle</em> for infantry in mobile warfare
of the future.</p>

<p>It is needless to consider cavalry, for
they suffer all the disabilities, save one, of
infantry, and in greater degree because
they offer a larger and more vulnerable
target. The sole exception is that they can
run away faster!</p>

<p>Then, with regard to field artillery—though
moderately effective against the
sluggish tanks of the Great War, its
chances would be infinitely less against a
modern tank zigzagging at over 20 m.p.h.,
and infinitesimal against them if launched
in masses. If it cannot hit, it will be hit.
In any case, its value depends on the
tanks coming to meet it; its <em>rôle</em> thus becomes
purely defensive. Only by being
fitted in a tank—the obvious solution—can
it compel the tank to come to action,
and resume its offensive <em>rôle</em> in a war of
movement.</p>

<p>Though the tank is not yet perfect—it
is only as old as the automobile of 1902,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
or the aeroplane of 1910—the fact that it
combines in itself the three essential
elements of warfare—hitting power, protection,
and mobility—makes it clearly
superior in normal country to any of the
existing arms, which are deficient in one,
or all, of these elements. To anyone who
has experienced the sense of helplessness
caused by the sight of the modern tanks
racing towards one at 20 m.p.h., sweeping
over banks and nullahs, swinging round
with amazing agility in their own length,
the question arises: “Can flesh and
blood, however heroic, be persuaded to
face them?” It is a sight to freeze the
blood of a witness with imagination to
grasp the demoralizing effect if their guns
and machine-guns were actually spitting
forth death.</p>

<p>The tank has its limitations; there are
certain types of ground on which it is
handicapped—hills, woods, and swamps,
and certain defences against which it is
helpless. By taking advantage of such
partially tank-proof terrain, infantry may
survive for a time. But the limitations of
the tank are exaggerated by the fact that
its tactics have not been thought out and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
adapted to its qualities and limitations.
Regarded as a mere prop to an arm—infantry—too
helpless to look after itself,
it has been frittered away in driblets or
under unsuitable conditions—as in the
swamps of Passchendaele.</p>

<p>To discover its true use let me suggest
an historical parallel:</p>

<p>The military bulwark of the Roman
Empire was its legions, for six centuries
the “queen of battle,” defying all efforts
to oppose them by like means. On the
<i>9th August, 378</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, on the plains of
Adrianople, they met a new challenge—the
cavalry of the Goths. “The Goths
swept down on the flank of the Roman
infantry, so tremendous was the impact
that the legions were pushed together in
helpless confusion.... Into this quivering
mass the Goths rode, plying sword
and lance against the helpless enemy.”
When the sun went down that evening,
it set not only on the great Roman Empire,
but on the reign of infantry—the
instrument and token of Roman
world-power. The age of cavalry was
ushered in.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred years later the German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
army was, in turn, the traditional symbol
of military power. For four years, her
machine-gunners, heirs of the Roman
legionaries, defied all the efforts of orthodox
tactics to overthrow them.</p>

<p>On the <i>8th of August, 1918</i>, the German
infantry legions were overrun and
slaughtered by the onset of the British
tanks, almost as helplessly as their forerunners
at Adrianople, exactly fifteen
hundred and forty years before. Let the
story be epitomized in the words of the
enemy, of Ludendorf himself:</p>

<p>“<em>August 8th was the black day of the
German army in the history of the war.</em>
The divisions in line allowed themselves
to be completely overwhelmed. Divisional
staffs were surprised in their headquarters
by enemy tanks.” On the final
phase of the war the verdict of Ludendorf
was “mass attacks by tanks ...
remained hereafter our most dangerous
enemies.”</p>

<p>The lesson to be drawn from this
historical analogy is that the tank attack
is the modern substitute for the cavalry
charge, the supreme value of which lay in
its speed and impetus of assault, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
demoralizing effect of its furious onset.
The deadliness of modern fire-weapons
brought about the extinction of the cavalry
charge, and with its disappearance
warfare became lopsided and stagnant.
The stalemates of recent campaigns are
to be traced to the lack of any means of
delivering and exploiting a decisive blow.
If, instead of regarding cavalry as men
on horseback, soldiers thought of it as <em>the
mobile arm</em>, the main cause of the interminable
siege warfare of the Russo-Japanese
and Great Wars would be
apparent. The practical view of history
lies in projecting the film of the past on
the blank screen of the future.</p>

<p>Once appreciate that tanks are not an
extra arm or a mere aid to infantry but
the modern form of heavy cavalry and
their true military use is obvious—to be
concentrated and used in as large masses
as possible for a decisive blow against the
Achilles’ heel of the enemy army, the
communications and command centres
which form its nerve system. Then not
only may we see the rescue of mobility
from the toils of trench-warfare, but with
it the revival of generalship and the art<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of war, in contrast to its mere mechanics.
Instead of machines threatening to become
the master of men, as they actually
did in 1914–18, they will give man back
opportunities for the use of his art and
brain, and on the battlefields of the future
may be expected the triumphs of an
Arbela, of quality over quantity. “It is
the <em>Man</em>, not men, who count in war.”
The tank assault of to-morrow is but the
long-awaited re-birth of the cavalry
charge, with the merely material changes
that moving fire is added to shock, and
that the armoured cavalry-tank replaces
the vulnerable cavalry-horse. Thus, to
paraphrase, “The cavalry is dead! Long
live the cavalry!”</p>

<p>The last war was the culmination of
brute force; the next will be the vindication
of moral force, even in the realm
of the armies. From the delusion that
the armed forces themselves were the real
objective in war, it was the natural
sequence of ideas that the combatant
troops who composed the armies should be
regarded as the object to strike at.</p>

<p>Thus progressive butchery, politely
called “attrition,” becomes the essence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of war. To kill, if possible, more of the
enemy troops than your own side loses, is
the sum total of this military creed, which
attained its tragi-comic climax on the
Western front in the Great War.</p>

<p>The absurdity and wrong-headedness
of this doctrine should surely have been
apparent to any mind which attempted to
think logically instead of blindly accepting
inherited traditions. War is but a
duel between two nations instead of two
individuals. A moment’s unprejudiced reflection
on the analogy of a boxing match
would be sufficient to reveal the objective
dictated by common sense. Only the most
stupid boxer would attempt to beat his
opponent by battering and bruising the
latter’s flesh until at last he weakens and
yields. Even if this method of attrition
finally succeeds, it is probable that the
victor himself will be exhausted and injured.
The victorious boxer, however, has
won his stake, and can afford not to worry
over the period of convalescence, whereas
the recovery of a nation is a slow and
painful process—as the people of these
Isles know to their cost.</p>

<p>A boxer who uses his intelligence, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
aims to strike a single decisive blow
as early as possible against some vital
point—the jaw or the solar plexus—which
will instantly paralyse his opponent’s
resistance. Thus he gains his
objective without himself suffering seriously.
Surely those responsible for the
direction of war might be expected to use
their intelligence as much as a professional
pugilist?</p>

<p>The first gleam of light on the military
horizon appeared in the closing stages of
the Great War. Recent publications have
revealed that in 1918 the Tank Corps
General Staff put forward a scheme, originating,
it is understood, with its chief,
Colonel Fuller, to strike at the nerve
centres of the German army instead of
at its flesh and blood—the fighting troops.
Reflection on the disaster of March, 1918,
showed that its extent was due far more
to the breakdown of command and staff
control than to the collapse of the infantry
resistance. A scheme was evolved to
launch a fleet of light fast tanks, under
cover of a general offensive, which should
pass through the German lines, and, neglecting
the fighting troops, aim straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
for the command and communication
centres in rear of the front. By the annihilation
of these, the disorganization and
capitulation of the combatant units was
visualized—for without orders, without
co-ordination, without supplies, an army
is but a panic and famine-stricken mob,
incapable of effective action.</p>

<p>This plan, adapted as the basic tactical
idea for 1919, had the war lasted, heralds
the dawn of scientific military thought in
its grasp of the truth that even the military
objective is a moral one—the paralysis
of the enemy’s command and not the
bodies of the actual soldiers.</p>

<p>“The wheel has come full circle,” for
this blow at the hostile command was the
method of Alexander, one of the greatest
captains in all history—and who, unlike
Napoleon, attained his ultimate political
objective in its entirety. It was thus at
Arbela that Alexander, with a small but
highly trained force, manœuvred to strike
through a gap at Darius, and with the
flight of its chief the huge Persian army
dissolved into a mob, its superior numbers
but an encumbrance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EVOLUTION">THE EVOLUTION OF “NEW MODEL” ARMIES</h2>
</div>


<p>“Rome was not built in a day”—nor
will be the armies of the “new model,”
though, since the history of the material
world is a tale of the replacement of the
human muscles by machines, the end
is inevitable. Civil developments in mechanical
science have repeatedly and
continuously influenced and changed the
methods of warfare. The longbows of
mediæval England had to give way to the
musket, the “wooden walls” of Nelson’s
time yielded to the ironclad, the sailing
ship was replaced by the steamship. But
natural conservatism and financial stringency
make rapid changes in peace-time
unlikely.</p>

<p>Thus the first stage will probably be to
provide infantry with mechanical legs to
carry them to the battlefield, to replace
horse-drawn artillery with motor-drawn,
or motor-borne guns, and to develop the
tank arm to the proportion that its tactical
importance as the heir of cavalry demands.
With their transport no longer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
tied to roads and railways, such armies
could well make advances of a hundred
miles in the day.</p>

<p>A longer period must elapse before
tanks swallow the older arms completely,
though the absorption of these Jonahs
will be hastened if the military leaders
of the nations realize that the gas-weapon
has come to stay, notwithstanding the
paper decrees of Leagues and Conferences.</p>

<p>To realize this we have only to ask the
question: How can the respective arms
protect themselves against gas? Aircraft,
by rising above it; tanks, by being
air-tight and producing their own oxygen
inside; infantry, cavalry, artillery, by
the use of some form of respirator. A
respirator is only proof against known
kinds of gas; it cannot be worn for long
without incapacitating its wearer from
active exertion; it cannot protect the
whole body, unless it be developed into a
complete diver’s suit, in which movement
would be almost impossible. If a man
cannot move freely, he cannot fight. If
a horse cannot move, what use is his
rider? If the artillery-man cannot serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the gun freely and the gun is immovable,
field artillery is useless. Therefore, if gas
becomes a standard weapon, we are left
with the tank and the aeroplane as the
sole effective arms for offensive action.
Only as the static defenders of the fortified
bases—the land-ports—of tanks and
aircraft will there be a future for infantry
and artillery, the former armed with
super-heavy armour-piercing machine-guns,
and the latter with anti-tank and
anti-aircraft guns.</p>

<p>How long even tanks will persist is a
moot point. To hit so small and rapidly
moving a target is not easy for the
aeroplane, and if it come low, the tank
can hit back. In the next lap of the
immemorial race between the means of
offence and protection, mobility is on the
side of the aeroplane, but gravity on that
of the tank—in increasing the degree of
armour.</p>

<p>Again, though gas is the weapon which
will sign the death-warrant of the traditional
arms, and by which the new arms
will attack the enemy nation, its very triumph
will cause one more revolution of
the eternal cycle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>Since both are gas-proof, the armour-piercing
projectile will come back into its
own for air and tank battles. Both
machines also are self-contained fighting
organisms, combining hitting power, mobility
and protection. What present type
of weapon already possesses this combination?
The warship.</p>

<p>Thus the tactics of tank <i>versus</i> tank
will conform to those of naval war, while
overhead Tennyson’s “Airy navies grappling
in the central blue” find literal and
not only figurative fulfilment.</p>

<p>Although overland warfare will ultimately
assume a close resemblance to sea
fighting, the novelists’ dream of land
“dreadnoughts” is unlikely of fruition.
The obstacles met with on land, the
benefit of using an already cleared and
graduated path, such as road systems
provide through and over these obstacles,
the load-capacity and width of bridges,
will limit the size of the landships. Even
the amphibious tank does not solve the
problem of getting out of a river with
steep banks.</p>

<p>Thus a concentrated essence of fighting
power, rather than bulk, will be the aim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of the tank designers of the future, just
as the organizers of armies will pin their
faith on quality instead of quantity,
turning for inspiration to Alexander
Xenophon and Gustavus Adolphus in
place of Clausewitz. Not “how large,”
but “how good” will be the standard of
to-morrow.</p>

<p>To sum up our deductions—The land
“punch” of the future will be delivered
by fleets of tanks, their communications,
maintained by cross-country and air
vehicles, offering no fixed and vulnerable
target for an enemy blow, either on land
or from the air. These quick-moving and
quick-hitting forces will advance by rapid
bounds into the enemy country to strike
at its vitals, establishing behind them,
as they progress, a chain of fortified
bases, garrisoned by heavy artillery and
land marines—<em>late</em> infantry. A proportion
of land marines might also be carried
in this tank fleet to be used as “landing
parties” to clear fortifications and hill
defences under cover of the fire from the
tank fleet.</p>

<p>Speed, on land as in the air, will dominate
the next war, transforming the battlefields<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
of the future from squalid trench
labyrinths into arenas where surprise and
manœuvre will reign again, restored to
life and emerging from the mausoleums
of mud built by Clausewitz and his successors.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="EPILOGUE">EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>


<p>The critic may ask why this survey has
been confined to weapons already known,
why, in our forecast, we have not endeavoured
to imitate the imaginative
flights of a Jules Verne or an H. G. Wells
in the past? The future may bring to
fruition the sensational dreams of the
novelist—discovery in bacteriological and
electrical science may lead to the wars of
the future being waged by means of the
germs, or the green, purple, and other
“death” rays, lurid in hue and effect,
which form the properties of the prophetic
novelist. But for a reasoned attempt to
forecast the future of war we cannot rely
on hypothetical discoveries of a revolutionary
nature—which may prove but
chimeras in the desert. For our suggestions
to have a practical value, they must
be based, not on the shifting sands of
speculations, but on solid rock—the evolutionary
development of weapons and powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
already available. We appreciate that
further scientific discoveries may modify
our conclusions as to the means by which
the moral objective is gained—but the
goal itself will remain true.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the danger and futility
of the Napoleonic doctrine of “absolute
war,” and of its fungus growth—the
“nation in arms,” has been demonstrated
so clearly that they may be cast on the
ash-heap. Let us never again confound
the means with the end. The goal in war
is the prosperous continuance of national
policy in the years after the war, and the
only true objective is the moral one of
subduing the enemy’s will to resist with
the least possible economic, human, and
ethical loss—which implies a far-sighted
choice, and blend, of the weapons most
suitable for our purpose. A statue of
General Sherman in Washington bears
this inscription: “The legitimate object
of war is a more perfect peace.” The
phrase is too narrow, and warring nations
reck little of legitimacy—but common
sense, reinforced by bitter experience,
should lead the grand strategists of the
future to the wider truth that a more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
perfect peace is the only <em>rational</em> object
of war, and that any military plan or act
which infringes this prospect causes a bad
debt on the balance sheet of victory. May
the nations and their political and military
chiefs remember the words of Solomon:
“Where there is no vision, the people
perish.” Future wars will be waged by
weapons that are the product of peace-time
industry; these weapons will be
directed against the nerve centres and
arteries of civil life, and if wisdom prevail,
the ultimate peace will be the guiding
star of the military policy and plans.
Weapons, target, and aim will alike be
civil. The future of war lies in the future
of peace.</p>
